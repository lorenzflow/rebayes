%% There is a class option to choose the math font

                                         % Modern (has noticable issues)
% \documentclass[mathfont=newtx]{uai2023} % newtx fonts (improves upon
                                          % ptmx; less tested, no support)
% NOTE: Only keep *one* line above as appropriate, as it will be replaced
%       automatically for papers to be published. Do not make any other
%       change above this note for an accepted version.

%% Choose your variant of English; be consistent
\usepackage[american]{babel}
% \usepackage[british]{babel}

%% Some suggested packages, as needed:
\usepackage{natbib} % has a nice set of citation styles and commands
    \bibliographystyle{plainnat}
    \renewcommand{\bibsection}{\subsubsection*{References}}
\usepackage{mathtools} % amsmath with fixes and additions
% \usepackage{siunitx} % for proper typesetting of numbers and units
\usepackage{booktabs} % commands to create good-looking tables
\usepackage{tikz} % nice language for creating drawings and diagrams

%% Provided macros
% \smaller: Because the class footnote size is essentially LaTeX's \small,
%           redefining \footnotesize, we provide the original \footnotesize
%           using this macro.
%           (Use only sparingly, e.g., in drawings, as it is quite small.)
