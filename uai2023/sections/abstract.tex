We propose a novel online approximate Bayesian inference algorithm for estimating the parameters of a nonlinear function from a (potentially non-stationary) data stream. 
The method is based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF),
but uses a novel, fully deterministic low-rank decomposition of the posterior precision matrix for improved efficiency.
In particular,
if the function to be estimated has $P$ unknown parameters,
and we use a rank $M$ approximation,
then each step takes $O(M P)$ time,
whereas the standard EKF takes $O(P^3)$ time.
This allows us to fit large neural networks in a fully online manner.
Our method generalizes previous work, based on orthogonal gradient descent,  by allowing the parameters to drift (to handle non-stationarity),
and by supporting
the use of a multidimensional, and potentially noisy, observation model (to handle classification problems).
We show experimentally that our method is much more effective than simpler alternatives, such as diagonal approximations to the EKF,
and methods based on stochastic gradient descent.
